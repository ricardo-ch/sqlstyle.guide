The guide is written in [Markdown][md-lang] and uses [Jekyll][jekyll] via
[GitHub's Pages][gh-pages] facility to render itself upon pushing to the `gh-pages`
branch.

## Sources

The markdown source for the guide can be found in [_includes/sqlstyle.guide.md][md]

## Installing for local development

There is a Gemfile supplied so you just need to follow the
[GitHub Pages documentation][gh-pages-help] to install the dependencies.

To then run it locally `bundle exec jekyll serve`
